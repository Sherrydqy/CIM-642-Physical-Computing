### positive(+) and Negative(-)
-put the led on the ground -> Negative????

### Electricity will always follow the path of least resistance

creating a loop between + and - -> electrical circuit

- each band on a resistor represents a digit
- Current in an LED can only flows from the positive to the Negative
- How to tell the difference between Anode and Cathode in an LED?
1. positive: longer leg
2. ? [not sure] positive has ?flag piece cutout on it

### Serial Cable
like a USB, it sends serial message between the computer and the device

###Pins
- pin13-2: digital input/output pins. on/off
## Never connect anything to pin 1 and 0
pins 1,0 are communication pins. They have connections to different part of the board.
They also have connection to the USB serial portal. So if they are blocked, you cannot connect to a computer.

- electricity circuit in pin 13 is specifically for LED

- electricity circuit in pin 13 is specifically for LED

When you set a pin to voltage   pin13 can give a positive voltage

pin has two functions: 1. outlet plug  2. giving voltage

- Parallel circuit
- Series circuit: one down, all down <- downside
- Switch (btn) has two sides connection
- led 2 20 om resistor
- switch 10k om resistor
